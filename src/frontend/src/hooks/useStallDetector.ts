/**
 * Detects when a streaming source has gone silent for longer than `stallMs`.
 *
 * `signature` should change whenever the stream emits new content (text token,
 * tool call, segment, etc). When it stops changing for `stallMs` we flip to
 * `waiting = true` and report the timestamp the stall started. This is the
 * frontend safety net for the case where the LLM buffers a long tool-call
 * payload server-side (e.g. MiniMax) and the backend's `tool_pending` event
 * either hasn't fired or fires late.
 *
 * `active` says whether there is a stream to watch at all, and it is not an
 * optimisation: hooks cannot be called conditionally, so every caller that
 * renders per message — which is what this one does — would otherwise hold a
 * 2Hz timer for every finished message in the conversation, forever. A long
 * history would then re-render itself twice a second with nothing streaming,
 * and each of those renders re-runs everything the message body computes.
