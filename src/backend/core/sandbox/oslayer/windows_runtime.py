"""Applying a Windows sandbox plan at the moment a process is spawned.

Windows confinement cannot be an argv prefix — a token has to be built and
handed to ``CreateProcessAsUser`` by whoever creates the process — so the
backend hands the spawning boundary a *plan*, already decided, and this module
applies it verbatim:

``writable_roots``
    Each an absolute path the command may write, with the existing paths inside
    it that must stay read-only.
``scratch_dir``
    The private directory standing in for the user's temp folder; absent when
    the policy grants no scratch space.
``state_dir``
    Where the roots currently carrying the sandbox's label are remembered.

A label is on-disk state that outlives the command, so a root stays labeled only
while a plan names it: at every spawn, roots labeled by earlier plans and named
by neither this plan nor a still-running command get their label taken back.
That keeps a one-off grant one-off, as the per-run token does on other
platforms.
