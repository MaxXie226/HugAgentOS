"""Windows backend: the low-integrity sandbox.

Windows has no way to express this confinement as a command-line wrapper the way
``sandbox-exec`` and ``bwrap`` do — the token has to be built and handed to
``CreateProcessAsUser`` by whoever creates the process. So this backend produces
a *plan* instead of an argv prefix, and the spawning boundary applies it.

This module owns the *deciding* half: it resolves the policy once and produces a
flat plan. The applying half lives in
:mod:`core.sandbox.oslayer.windows_runtime` and runs inside whatever process
creates the child — for the desktop, the long-lived sidecar, so the token is
built without an extra process per command.

What the backend can and cannot enforce is declared, not discovered at runtime:

* **Writes** — enforced. The command runs at Low integrity, and only the roots
  of the current plan carry a Low label (labels left by earlier plans are taken
  back at spawn, see :mod:`core.sandbox.oslayer.windows_runtime`); everything
  else is Medium or higher and not writable. The honest limit is the few Low
  areas other low-integrity software keeps for itself, such as
  ``%USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow``.
* **Reads** — *not* enforceable here. Integrity levels block writes upward, not
  reads, so a policy that narrows reads or denies any path is refused rather
  than half-applied. Codex refuses in the same situation and for the same
  reason.
* **Network** — no mechanism without administrator rights (the filtering
  platform needs them). A policy that restricts the network is refused.

Every one of those refusals is surfaced to the permission layer, which turns it
into a message telling the user which permission scope would let the command run
— never into a silently unconfined execution.
